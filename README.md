# ArduinoLCDScrollOneLine
This repository contains example code for showing text on a HD44780-based display (or I2C variants) with a fixed line and a scrolling line
It is a modified version of the Wizzzkid's sketch, because because when I tired his sketch it wasn't working, so I decided to debug it.
